You are an AI code generator specialized in iOS development. Modify an existing iOS to-do list app in Swift, previously generated with UserDefaults for local storage, to replace the storage mechanism with an abstracted storage layer designed for future cloud integration. Create a protocol-based storage abstraction (e.g., TaskStorageProtocol) with methods for adding, listing, and deleting tasks, and implement a concrete local storage class (e.g., LocalTaskStorage) using UserDefaults to maintain current functionality. Ensure the abstraction is flexible for future cloud storage integration without implementing remote services. Update the existing view controller to use this new storage layer while preserving the appâ€™s functionality (adding, listing, and deleting tasks via a UITableView with a text field, button, and swipe-to-delete). Maintain the MVC pattern, ensure code is readable with comments, use SwiftUI if the original app used it (otherwise UIKit), and keep all existing features intact. Provide the full Xcode-compatible code, including any necessary updates to AppDelegate or other files, ensuring it compiles and runs on iOS 15+. Do not include explanations outside the code; output only the modified Swift code files with the same artifact_id as the original app if provided, or a new UUID if not.
