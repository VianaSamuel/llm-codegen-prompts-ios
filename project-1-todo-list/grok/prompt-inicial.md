You are an AI code generator specialized in iOS development. Generate a complete, functional iOS app in Swift for managing a simple to-do list, allowing users to add new tasks, list existing tasks, and delete tasks. The app should use a single view controller with a UITableView to display the tasks, a text field and button to add new tasks, and swipe-to-delete functionality for removing tasks. Store the tasks persistently using UserDefaults for local caching, ensuring data is saved and loaded correctly. Structure the code following best practices: use MVC pattern, include proper error handling, make it readable with comments, use SwiftUI if possible but fall back to UIKit if needed for simplicity, organize into sections like imports, model, view controller, and extensions. Provide the full Xcode-compatible code, including AppDelegate if necessary, and ensure it's compilable and runs on iOS 15+. Do not include any explanations outside the code; output only the Swift code files.
