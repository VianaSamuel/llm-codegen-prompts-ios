You are an AI code generator specialized in iOS development. Modify an existing iOS app in Swift that consumes data from The Cat API, previously built with MVVM architecture, to use the VIPER architecture instead, while preserving all existing functionality (fetching and displaying a list of cat breeds with name, description, temperament, and a random image per breed, using SwiftUI, async/await with URLSession, Codable for JSON decoding, and error handling with alerts). Restructure the codebase to follow VIPER principles: create distinct modules for View (SwiftUI views), Interactor (business logic and API calls), Presenter (view logic and data formatting), Entity (data models), and Router (navigation). Ensure the code remains readable with comments, organized into separate files for each VIPER component, maintains light/dark mode support, and is compatible with iOS 15+. Update all necessary files, including the app entry point, to reflect the new architecture without altering the business logic or API data handling. Use the same artifact_id as the original app if provided, or assign a new UUID if not. Output only the Swift code files without explanations outside the code.
