## Prompt Utilizado
```txt
You are an AI code generator specialized in iOS development. Generate a complete, functional iOS app in Swift that consumes data from The Cat API, specifically fetching a list of cat breeds and displaying them in a list view, allowing users to select a breed to view detailed information including name, description, temperament, and a random image for that breed. Use SwiftUI for the user interface, async/await for networking with URLSession, proper JSON decoding with Codable structs for breeds and images, implement error handling with alerts for network failures, ensure the architecture follows MVVM pattern for adaptability (with a ViewModel managing data fetching and state), make the code readable with comments, organized into sections like imports, models, view models, views, and app entry point, support light/dark mode, and ensure it's compatible with iOS 15+. Provide the full Xcode-compatible code in a single Swift file if possible, or multiple if necessary, but output only the Swift code without any explanations outside the code.
